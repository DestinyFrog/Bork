# Introduction
This is a mini-project
it works like a "Game FrameWork"
And i called it BÃ–RK ( Dog Song in Swedish, or something like that )

Sorry, i am not so good with documentations
- Actually, i am not so good with english ( idk, whatever )

## Info
- I recommend to use this with 'Visual Studio Code'
- It uses Typescript like main programing language
- But you can use Javascript too
- It is all converted to basic HTML

# It helps you to:
- Loop Method
- Detect Keyboard Input
- Draw Graphics
- Detect Collisions ( Circle and Rectangle )
- Render Animations ( Sprites and Functions )
- Play Audio

# Project "Features"

## goals:
    - use Typescript Intelisense literaly EVERYWHERE
    - use Types and Interfaces EVERYWHERE

## done:
    - Keyboard Input ( by keyCode )
    - Work with Scenes
    - Draw Graphics
    - Animation With Sprites
    - Collisions
    - Audio

## todo:
    - Mouse Detection
    - Tilemap System

### maybe do:
    - turn 'Color' a type
    - physics ( like gravity )
